# Blender .blend files that are located on a remote computer that you want to render. Multiple .blend files 
# can go into here. Also be sure to include any baked data such as fluid simulations along with the .blend 
# file. Be sure directories for baked data are relative and each one has a different name for each .blend 
# file placed here.
# Please be sure to setup the animation option in the .blend file so that it renders images such as PNG and options are set so that it
# uses place holders and does not overwrite. This is what allows multiple computers to contribute to
# rendering the same .blend file.
# Once all images are rendered, ffmpeg can be used to pull them all together into a video along with audio if you want that as well.
# i.e. ffmpeg -i "MUSIC.WAV" -i "IMG_%04d.jpg" -pix_fmt yuv420p -vf scale=1280:-1 -r 30 -c:v libx264 -preset slow -crf 20 -x264opts keyint=75 -c:a aac -ar 48000 -b:v 5000 -y -threads 6 "final.mp4"
# For Linux, to mount a Windows share
#   mount -t cifs //192.168.1.10/RemoteDirectory /mnt/LocalDirectory -o username=user,password=pwd,domain=domainIfApplicable
